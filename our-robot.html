                    We spent a lot of time in the ‘design’ phase of our robot building. Prior to receiving the rulebook
                    for this year’s competition, we wanted to establish a basic build for a mobile robot. We’ve decided
                    to not use wood as our primary material like previous years, and instead use a 2x2x2 ft extruded
                    aluminium frame, along with 3D-printed components, and two wooden surfaces <br>

        <section class="para-2nd">
            <p> We’ve built a prototype but realised that our frame wouldn’t work for the competition. We needed to
                start a new build. Our new robot is composed of a conveyor belt at the centre front of the robot,
                designed to collect the golf balls and bring them to the second level of the challenge. It utilises four
                Mecanum Wheels powered by a 15v battery in order to move. Next, we printed our mechanisms like our
                ‘scooper’ to attach to our robot. In addition to this wooden floors were used to hold our robot’s
                battery and other components.

                Hardships were encountered during our time here at LTMHS’s robotics club. Lack of motivation, along with
                missing parts we were planning on using for our robot’s build being included. Some days, we let the
                burden of everyday life get in our way, which made us lose steam, but we triumphed and pushed our way
                through. That’s what makes the robotics’ team an amazing place, no matter where we come from, or how
                days are going, once you enter the robotic room, you’re welcomed to an awesome team of students and
                mentors.
