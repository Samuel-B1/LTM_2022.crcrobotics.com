                school activities such as Robotics, Woodworking, Writer’s club, Yearbook committee, and more. There are
                even sports teams such as Basketball, Hockey, Futsal, etc. These extracurricular activities are greatly
                enjoyed by students all over the school.

                Ontop of the many extra curricular activities, LTMHS organises numerous outings for its students. For
                example it isn’t unusual for students in higher grade levels to visit locations outside of the country
                for fun and educational purposes. In addition to this there are smaller trips for any grade class, which
                allow students to visit nearby cities, go skating, or even go to a Halloween carnival!
