                    Every year, students in high-schools and CEGEPs across Canada participate in the Canadian Robotics
                    Competition A.K.A. the CRC. This competition is the type that lets us students use and develop our
                    technological skills and abilities. Once again students at LTM have chosen to participate in this
                    event, and we’re bringing our A game!

                When this school first started participating in the CRC competition, the team was comprised of only
                three members. With very few resources they built their first robot. This team of capable individuals
                had to make due with what they could, however over the years, LTM’s Robotics team has grown along with
                the number of members in our group. LTM has come a long way. With a group of over 20 brilliant minds and
                enough supplies, we can now brainstorm plenty of ideas for this year’s competition.
